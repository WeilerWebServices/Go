## Commands

### golang_build

The `golang_build` command executes various `go` commands and accepts the
following args:

 - `task`: A string of the build task to perform. Accepts the following values:
   - `"build"`: executes `go build -v`
   - `"run"`: executes `go run -v {current_filename}`
   - `"test"`: executes `go test -v`
   - `"benchmark"`: executes `go test -v -bench=.`
   - `"install"`: executes `go install -v`
   - `"clean"`: executes `go clean -v`
   - `"cross_compile"`: executes `go build -v` with `GOOS` and `GOARCH` set
 - `flags`: A list of strings to pass to the `go` executable as flags. The list
   of valid flags can be determined by executing `go help {task}` in the
   terminal.

### golang_build_get

The `golang_build_get` command executes `go get -v` and accepts the following
args:

 - `url`: A string of the URL to get, instead of prompting the user for it.
 - `flags`: A list of strings to pass to the `go` executable as flags. The list
   of valid flags can be determined by executing `go help get` in the
   terminal.

### golang_build_terminal

The `golang_build_terminal` command opens a terminal to the directory containing
the currently open file. The command does not accept any args.
